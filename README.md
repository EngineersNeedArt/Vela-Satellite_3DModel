Iterations of the Vela model.
</p>

This is a simple model of the Vela satellite I created using the [Blender](https://www.blender.org) software. I have included the files I used to create the model in this repo.

The model was created to be printed at a fairly small scale. It lacks detail for a larger print — was meant as a prop for my Space Tug model that I also created in Blender (the Space Tug has manipulator arms and I wanted something for them to manipulate).

I chose the Vela satellite in part because of its size relative to the Space Tug — I didn't want the satellite to dwarf the Space Tug nor be dwarfed. Also, the Vela was more or less of the same era as the proposed (1970) Space Tug.

### Vela, the satellite

Wikipedia discusses the [Vela satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vela_(satellite)) in depth so I won't repeat that here. It is a fairly fascinating piece of Cold-War technology though that you may find interesting if you had not heard about the satellite. Read too about the famous *incident* involving Vela.

Here though are a handful of reference images though to give you an idea of what the Vela looked like. They were, by the way, launched in pairs with a spin-stabilizing thruster module where the two were joined. Also, there were a few iterations of the satellite so there may be some discrepancy between some reference images you may come across. I'm not convinced that a museum replica is a very reliable reference either.

### 3D Model

I used Blender to create the Vela model, then I exported the model as an .STL file, brought it into a "slicer" program to ready it for a resin printer, and then printed it from resin. When slicing the model, I scaled it such that the resulting print would be about 3 cm in diameter.

It took a number of iterations to get the final model. Initially, for example, I tried creating the complete Vela satellite as one file and printing it complete. If you are familiar with 3D printing you are aware that some supports need to be added to hold the model as it is being "extruded" in the resin vat — unfortunately the side of the model that was being held by supports always looked inferior to the unsupported side.

The solution turned out to be to split the model into half more or less along the equator of the satellite. Since Vela is fairly symmetrical between its two hemispheres you can simply print the same model twice and use some CA glue to join the two halves to make a complete model.

Assembly is that simple.

Painting is not too difficult either. There are fascinating color-shifting paints that do a fantastic job of simulating the iridescence of solar panels from the Vela era. I chose an Electric-Blue/Intense-Violet paint from Vallejo paints that is part of their Space Dust set.

The instruction tell you to begin though with a glossy black base coat before applying the color-shifting paint. When dry, it can then be followed with the color-shift paint.

To finish the model I wanted to trim the edges with a metallic paint. Rather than try to do this by hand, I instead attempted to create a set of masks to cover the solar panels on the model and use a spray coat of a metallic paint.

I created the masks from vinyl using a vinyl cutter and the Silhouette Studio software that came with it. The Silhouette Studio file is included in the repo (I am unable to convert it to something standard like SVG).

The masks were carefully applied to the solar panels and the model sprayed with a metallic color.

Removing the masks with a pair of needle tweezers reveals the final model. From the proper distance the model looks quite nice.
